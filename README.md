This project presents a web application that uses deep learning to detect cardiac anomalies in ECG images.
The method uses a VGG16 CNN model that has already been trained and refined using a dataset of ECG pictures classified as "Normal" or "Abnormal." 
Through a straightforward web interface, users can upload ECG scans, and the backend analyzes the picture to produce a prediction and provide real-time feedback. 
In order to facilitate early screening and lessen the workload for medical practitioners, this strategy seeks to offer a scalable, affordable, and easily available diagnostic assistance tool.
ECG interpretation has historically relied largely on expert analysis, which can be laborious, subjective, and prone to human error, particularly in settings with limited resources. 
Recent developments in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have created new opportunities for automated medical diagnostics in order to address these issues. 
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in particular, have demonstrated impressive performance in picture classification tasks and are being used more and more in biomedical image analysis.
